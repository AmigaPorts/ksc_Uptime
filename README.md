# ksc_Uptime
Uptime  tells you how long your Amiga has been going since the last reboot.
There  is  no need to install a 'server', the uptime is calculated from the
computer's EClock. This can be affected by hardware bashing, but not by any
OS software.

## **Requirements**
* Requires 2.0 or better.
* Requires 68020 or better.

## **Disclaimer**
